      <h1>Recipe Finder</h1>
      <p class="lead">
        This "Recipe Finder" web app let's you search different recipes based on
        a list of ingredients. It's fully responsive, i.e. works on almost all
        the major viewports, from the widest to the (possibly) the smallest. ðŸ˜€
        Almost all the major edge cases and errors are handled gracefully,
        making the web app very user-friendly. From the returned list of
        recipes, you can click the button "See Recipe" to learn more by visiting
        the url for the recipe detials. You can click on "Add to Favorites" to
        add recipes to your favorites, and "Share" to share recipes with other
        people.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="lead">
        The recipes that are added to your favorites are stored in your
        browser's local storage (meaning, it's going to be available until you
        clear your browser cache and storage). Also, you can go to
        <a href="/favorites.html">the Favorites Page</a>
        for taking a look at all your favorites.
