# MMC Web Code Challenge

This is a basic challenge to determine how you approach ambiguous challenges. Show us your creativity in interpreting these partial instructions to give us a working project!

## The Ask

You will need to make a small application that can search for recipes and save them to a list of favorites.

For this we'll use the free api at [Recipe Puppy](http://www.recipepuppy.com/). Documentation [can be found here.](http://www.recipepuppy.com/about/api/)

There are some basic mocks in `/mocks` -- showing the poor artistry of the random engineer assigned to the task.

- Fork this project.
- Complete the items below using any common front-end libraries only (jQuery, Lodash/Underscore).
- Avoid front-end frameworks such as AngularJS and React, Vue, Knockout, Backbone, etc.
- (( This must be entirely in the front end. Server side languages or platforms will be immediately disqualified ))
- Commit this to your own git repository (any of the platforms) and send the link back.

### What should it do?

- Provide search functionality to query the api for recipes.
- Show a list of recipes. Information should contain a thumbnail, recipe name, and number of ingredients.
- Provide the functionality to add a recipe to my favorites.
- Provide a way to get to a page showing all of my favorites.
- Favorites should persist between page views.
- Site should work on mobile devices.
- Should have a very small code footprint.

#### Extra credit:

- Add navigation that makes sense.
- Add the ability to remove favorites.
- Create the ability to share my favorites with others.
